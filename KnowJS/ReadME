Scripts are provided and executed as plain text. They don’t need special preparation or compilation to run
JS can be run anywhere JS Engine exists.A JavaScript engine is a software component that executes JavaScript code.
What can in-browser JavaScript do?
->
Modern JavaScript is a “safe” programming language. It does not provide low-level access to memory or the CPU, because it was initially created for browsers which do not require it.

JavaScript’s capabilities greatly depend on the environment it’s running in. For instance, Node.js supports functions that allow JavaScript to read/write arbitrary files, perform network requests, etc.

In-browser JavaScript can do everything related to webpage manipulation, interaction with the user, and the webserver.

What makes JavaScript unique?
